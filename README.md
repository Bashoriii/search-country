# Country Search Engine
This React application utilizes the [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to provide detailed information about various countries. Users can easily search for a country using the search bar, which displays the top 5 matching suggestions. Upon selection, users are redirected to a new page containing detailed information about the chosen country, including its currency, capital, region, and more.
